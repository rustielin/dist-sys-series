# Distributed Systems Workshop Series with libp2p

## Installation

### Docker

Install the Docker image here. TODO: in the future, don't require build on each change, instead use volumes to sync changes

```
docker build -t dist-demo .
```

TODO: install all demos. For now, need to enter containers and `go build -o <name> .` for each demo


### Blockade 

Blockade only supports python2 for now...

```
python2 -m pip install blockade
```
